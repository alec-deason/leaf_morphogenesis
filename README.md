This is a work in progress tutorial about writing a casual (ie with artistic not scientific goals) implementation of a biologically plausable leaf morphogenesis model based on [this paper](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/leaves.nph.2017.pdf).

My expectation is that this repository will eventually host the final code as a usable library and the tutorial itself will live somewhere else. For the time being they will be mixed together here as I work out how to write the tutorial portion.
